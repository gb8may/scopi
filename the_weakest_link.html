												<h2><strong>The Weakest Link of the Chain</strong></h2>
												<h3>The End User Machine</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Nowadays many companies invest in the qualification of their IT team.
												As security measures increase, new certifications come into existence and the
												fight for a good position becomes more and more fierce.<br/>
												A good technology manager needs to get out of the box and understand how business
												works world-wide. You need to follow some more professional social networks,
												such as linkedIn to keep an eye on every new threat that comes up.<br/>
												More important than having a good information security policy is to use this policy
												effectively. It's no use owning the most expensive software and appliances, or the
												most capable professionals if you do not train your end user. It is in the end user
												that the danger lives.<br/>
												Every day we encounter social engineering scams, where a simple phone call causes
												the user to report sensitive corporate data.
												Each day it becomes clearer that the weakest link in the chain is the user.<br/> A
												user who only reads information security policy is a vulnerable user. Police need to be
												indoctrinated and users need to be trained.<br/>
												At <font style='font-style:italic;'>cybrary.it</font> we can find some courses aimed at users and lay people, guiding them
												how to handle each scenario, whether it is a false link from a service supplier or
												an email with an incredible offer. When you learn to identify these threats, the IT
												manager can say that have a strong T.I team, no matter how good and expensive
												your appliances and applications are, or how many certifications your analysts have.<br/>
												Below, one of <font style='font-style:italic;'>cybrary.it's</font> free courses for end users. Check out!
